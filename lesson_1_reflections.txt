How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It pointed out exactly what was different between the two files, instead of having to scan thru the file manually which would have taken a long time.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Will let me see the history of a file and remind me when and why I made a change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You are in charge, that is a good thing!  But you may not commit frequently enough or commit too frequently.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In programming you want to keep track of multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log - Shows commit history
git diff - shows what changed between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because you can always see what you did wrong and revert back!
